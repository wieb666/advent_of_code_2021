# advent_of_code_2021

Here is my attempt to tackle these challenges.\
I will try to not look up and copy other peoples code. I might go and look at other solutions when I am finished and update my code in order to learn from others\
\
I did try and reached up until day 15, where I was able to do it, after day 12 I need help\
The most help I got from https://github.com/anthonywritescode and his youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/c/anthonywritescode/ \
I will not continue, because I was copying more code than I was writing for the days after day 15.
